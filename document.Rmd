This the documentation for the **Coursera Data Products Class**, week 4 assignment. In this document I'll describe how to use my application.

#Getting Started

This application has two data inputs:

**Height** - where the user has to input his height in METERS.
**Weight** - where the user has to input his weight in KILOS.

After completing this step, hitting "submit" button will make the calculations for entered values and the results will be displayed on left side of the screen. 

Go to the [application] (https://fabiano.shinyapps.io/DataProducts/)
